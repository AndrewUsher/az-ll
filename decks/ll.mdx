# What is Gatsby?

- open-source React-based framework for building fast websites and applications
- streamlines the setup and configuration of your build
- can pull data into your UI from any and all of your sources
- amazing performance and current web best practices are built into Gatsby sites.

---

# Benefits

---

# Site Speed

- built with performance in mind from its inception
- consistently 2-3x faster than similar sites built with other tools – pages load in milliseconds rather than seconds
- automated performance optimizations include pre-fetching resources, code splitting, statically generating HTML, and Google’s PRPL Pattern

---

# Modern Web tools

- built with React - currently the most popular framework for developing web apps, and data can be pulled into your React components via GraphQL
- also built to pull data from any source so you can pick the best tool for each job and function your site needs to perform

---

# Plugins and Features

- just about every feature you could want for building a state-of-the-art website or web app is available through Gatsby
- if it isn’t already built in, there’s an extensive library of available plugins

---

# Data Integration

- sources like CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, and other data sources of all flavors.
- can also pull unstructured data directly into pages using API calls specifically crafted for this purpose
  - works great with smaller websites which can later be scaled up effortlessly if necessary

# Good Developer Experience

- Maintained by you -- your best dev set up the asset build pipeline, deploys, and dev server. She handles library upgrades and is the only one who understand how all the pieces fit.
- Undocumented -- new team members frequently blocked on weird quirks you forgot to write down
- Stack traces of death -- bugs throw application errors, NGINX timeouts, and other errors that frontend developers find impossible to debug
