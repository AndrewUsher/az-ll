## Static Site Generation With Gatsby
### Andrew Usher
#### 03.04.20 AutoZone Lunch And Learn

---

# What is Gatsby?

- open-source React-based framework for building fast websites and applications
- streamlines the setup and configuration of your build
- can pull data into your UI from any and all of your sources
- amazing performance and current web best practices are built into Gatsby sites.

---

# Benefits

---

# Site Speed

- built with performance in mind from its inception
- consistently 2-3x faster than similar sites built with other tools – pages load in milliseconds rather than seconds
- automated performance optimizations include pre-fetching resources, code splitting, statically generating HTML, and Google’s PRPL Pattern

---

# Modern Web tools

- built with React - currently the most popular framework for developing web apps, and data can be pulled into your React components via GraphQL
- also built to pull data from any source so you can pick the best tool for each job and function your site needs to perform

---

# Plugins and Features

- just about every feature you could want for building a state-of-the-art website or web app is available through Gatsby
- if it isn’t already built in, there’s an extensive library of available plugins

---

# Data Integration

- sources like CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, and other data sources of all flavors.
- can also pull unstructured data directly into pages using API calls specifically crafted for this purpose
  - works great with smaller websites which can later be scaled up effortlessly if necessary

---

<!-- # Common Concerns

---

# Our site uses a lot of dynamic content and components. Isn’t Gatsby a static site generator?

---

## Yes, and No

- it is, but there’s more to it 
- statically generates HTML content using React DOM and server-side APIs 
- this static HTML content can also be enhanced with client-side JavaScript via React hydration

---

# Do I have to learn GraphQL to use Gatsby?

---

## No

- GraphQL is used to pull the content from all your different sources into Gatsby in a consistent, unified way
- You don’t have to use GraphQL to do this, but learning GraphQL will equip you to create new integrations more easily
